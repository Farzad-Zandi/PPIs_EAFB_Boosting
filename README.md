## Abstract
<p align="justify">
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial for regulating cellular functions and play a fundamental role in many biological processes. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of PPIs is essential for developing new drugs and therapies for various diseases. In this paper, we present a new model for predicting PPIs. Our model is based on embedded artificial feeding birds' feature selection using boosting algorithms. We extract features such as Autocorrelation Descriptors, Blocks of Amino Acid Substitution Matrix, Conjoint Triad, Composition Transition Distribution, Dipeptide Composition, Dipeptide Deviation from Expected Mean value, Pseudo Amino Acid Composition and Quasi Sequence Order features from amino acid sequences. We then use our proposed feature selection method to reduce their dimensions and compute prediction accuracy. We compare the accuracy of fusion features versus the best-selected features using AdaBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, LogitBoost, SnapBoost, and XGBoost boosting methods. To maximize efficiency, we feed LightGBM and XGBoost to the ensemble Voting method as a final classification. We validate our proposed model using two common datasets of S.cerevisiae and H.pylori. Our results demonstrate that our model's prediction accuracy reaches 94.77 and 89.47, respectively, with only 10 percent of fusion features, which is superior to some state-of-the-art PPIs methods.
